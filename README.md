Speech to Text and Text to Speech using Python

## Project Summary

Developed a **Speech to Text and Text to Speech conversion system** using Python that enables seamless interaction between humans and machines. The system converts spoken language into text and also converts written text back into natural-sounding speech.

---

## Problem Statement

Typing and reading text-based inputs may not be convenient for all users, especially in hands-free or accessibility-focused environments. This project addresses the need for **voice-enabled interaction** by implementing speech recognition and speech synthesis techniques.

---

## Objectives

* Convert spoken audio input into text
* Convert written text into audible speech
* Enable hands-free human–computer interaction
* Improve accessibility and usability

---

## Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
* **Libraries:**

  * SpeechRecognition
  * Pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech)
  * Pyaudio
  * Google Speech API (for speech recognition)

## How It Works

###  Speech to Text

1. Microphone captures user’s voice
2. Audio signal is processed
3. Speech recognition model converts audio into text
4. Recognized text is displayed as output

###  Text to Speech

1. User provides text input
2. Text is processed by speech synthesis engine
3. System generates audible speech output

---

## Features

* Real-time speech recognition
* Accurate text transcription
* Natural-sounding speech output
* Simple and interactive interface
* Hands-free operation

---

## How to Run the Project

### 1️. Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio
```

> ⚠️ **Note:**
> For `pyaudio`, installation may vary by OS.

---

### 2️. Run the Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open **`speech to text and viceversa.ipynb`** and run all cells sequentially.

---

## Results

* Successfully converted speech to text with high accuracy
* Generated clear and understandable speech from text
* Demonstrated effective bidirectional voice interaction

---

## Applications

* Virtual assistants
* Accessibility tools
* Voice-controlled systems
* Smart devices and IoT applications

---

## Future Enhancements

* Support for multiple languages
* Noise reduction for better accuracy
* GUI-based application
* Mobile and web deployment
